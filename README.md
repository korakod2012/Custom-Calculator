This is version 2 of Caculator App that i created.

Update feature :

-added Grant write permission when open application it first time.
-added Share feature - It's a button on top of TextView ( I wanted this feature because of I like to shared result to another app )
-support decimal point.
-Saved screenshot that send out to store inside internal storage -->  "Android/data/com.calculator/cache/YourScreenShot.jpg"



Pendding feature ( I decide to stop on this version )

-Separate textView to be 2 object for support multiple line, so it can support history of number that you calculated.
-Change location of screenshot to be Gallery.
