This is version 2 of Caculator App that i created.

Update feature :

- added Grant write permission when open application it first time.
- added Share feature - It's a button on top of TextView ( I wanted this feature because of I like to shared result to another app )
- support decimal point.
- Saved screenshot that send out to store inside internal storage -->  "Android/data/com.calculator/cache/YourScreenShot.jpg"



Pendding feature ( I decide to stop on this version )

- Separate textView to be 2 object for support multiple line, so it can support history of number that you calculated.
- Change location of screenshot to be Gallery.
- Change apk name
- Change icon of application when displan on device
